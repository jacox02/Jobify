**This is Jobify Project, an open source work site.**

This was born as a college project for one of our computer cience, made with love and coffee for the community.

First of all you have to install the dependencies of the backend and the frontend, you could do this with:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Then you have to run both sides of the web app, the backend has two ways to run, the development mode and the normal mode.

Development mode command: `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
Normal mode command: `npm start` or `yarn start`.

The frontend just has the normal mode that could be started with: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
